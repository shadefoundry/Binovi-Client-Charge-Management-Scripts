# Charge-Management-Scripts
* A collection of scripts written in Python to take in a spreadsheet and filter it based on different requirements
* The script then outputs separate spreadsheets based on inconsistencies in the data to be manually reviewed in the future
* For legal reasons, no spreadsheets are included in this repo

# How to Use:
* Open pycharm project or Jupyter Notebook 
* Ensure that paths to files in checkOliListPayments.py and checkSessionCharges.py are pointing to the correct location
* Right click main.py and click <Run 'main'>
* Watch as the files are magically generated for you!
* Remember to move the files because they are regenerated each time!
