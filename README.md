# Charge-Management-Scripts
* A collection of scripts written in Python to take in a spreadsheet and filter it based on different requirements
* The script then outputs separate spreadsheets based on inconsistencies in the data to be manually reviewed in the future
* For legal reasons, no spreadsheets are included in this repo
